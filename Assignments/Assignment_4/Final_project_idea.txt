analyze the 'alien mummy' genome and try to compile an actual 'alien' genome based on the 3 samples given with all human contamination removed, or prove that the DNA sequences are garbage (the more likely option).

NHI has all 3 genomes available and BLAST can be used to try and remove any human DNA contamination.

there will probably be a few ways to visualize the data but one way to ensure that I have some data to work with would be to compare how much of the DNA was human-contaminated DNA against how much of the DNA was of unknown-origin
